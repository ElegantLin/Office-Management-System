# Office-Management-System
An office management system given by the Party Office, Tongji University.

Er... I don't why I will choose to finish this project...

Actually, I am very busy... Maybe the love of computer science and nature science in my deepest heart. Who knows~

And I find it not so hard to finish such a code in console at least much better than my 1st project to fetch the information of Oxford Dictionary...

Ahhhh, Dictionary! I haven't reviewed the TOFEL!!

F**K...

No time to waste... 

All in all, coding itself is not a task for me and I just like computers and coding.

A Computer, itself is the best thing with Darwinism, E=mc^2 or something like this, which will be remembered forever. 
Like my major, electricity/electrical, computer science has the power to drive the world and change the world and one's lifestyle.

Hope you have a good time in FDU.

Actually, PKU, TSU, FDU are the real dream lands...

Hope you all the best there. I am happy to see your effort finally pays off.

You raise me up. You inspire me!

Practice makes perfect ^_^~~

And wish me a brighter future. I will work harder.

Now or Never. 

The Best or Nothing.

My code & my life & my style.
